<p>As we get closer to Earth Day 2021 we have a few environmental data projects in the works. Collaborating with <a href="http://www.mtna.us/">our partner MTNA</a> to ingest, process, clean up, and publish environmental data APIs using <a href="https://www.richdataservices.com/">their RDS solution</a>. Taking very rich environmental datasets that take some heavy lifting to put to use and make them more usable by publishing them as simple web APIs. We recently recorded one of our working sessions to demonstrate our process for selecting certain data sets, and then highlighting the work that goes into processing and normalizing them to make them easier to work with as an API.</p>

<p>The next step with these three datasets is to publish them and make available as simple APIs using RDS, then publish each of them in a public workspace, making the environmental data more accessible via a series of collections. Helping make valuable environmental data that is available as downloadable files available in smaller more bite size and usable chunks via APIs so that they can be used in applicaitons and as part of automation using Postman. We will publish another update once these datasets are available via APIs, and share another video walkthrough of how we are making environmental data more accessible using APIs.</p>
