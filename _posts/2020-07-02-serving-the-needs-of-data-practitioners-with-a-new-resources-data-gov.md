We are excited to announce the relaunch of a new resources.data.gov, an online repository of policies, tools, case studies, and other resources to support data governance, management, exchange, and use throughout the federal government. The site is a joint effort of OMB, the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives, and GSA, as required by the OPEN Government Data Act, Title II of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act. This resource promises to become a central hub that gathers, publicizes, and shares high-quality data tools and resources, thereby supporting and amplifying the efforts and products of groups and individual data managers and practitioners across government.
