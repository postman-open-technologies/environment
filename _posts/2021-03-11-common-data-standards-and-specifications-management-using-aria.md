<p><a href="http://www.mtna.us/">Our partners at MTNA</a> gave us a walkthrough of the Aria standards and specification management systems and API this week, showing the robust approach they took to deliver common data patterns for use by the New Zealand government, as well as more recently Stats Canada.The system provides a very mature look at how common data that we all depend on as part of our systens and applications can be managed, versioned, evolved, then made more usable via an API. I recorded the MTNA team's very detailed walkthrough the project, and how the API can make this valuable data more accessible and usable.</p>

<p>There are so many common data sets like states, provinces, postal codes, weights, and measurement that we depend on daily within our applications and systems, yet for some reason we all seem to reinvent the wheel when it comes to creating, storing, and evolving. Imagine if there were an official national dataset like Aria in New Zealand and Stats, Canada. But, more importantly what that everyone in the public and private sector got behind when it came to putting to use and contributing to. It would save so much time and resources that would allow the rest of us to focus on the digital resource we are best at, making Aria a pretty compelling approach to managing the worlds standards and specifications, while also organizing them by country, region, or other bounded context.</p>
