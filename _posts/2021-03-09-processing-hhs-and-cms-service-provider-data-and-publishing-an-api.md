<p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recently mandated that any state doing business with CMS needed to publish a FHIR compliant API. To help us understand what this neans for healthcare providers we've begun working with <a href="http://www.mtna.us/">our partners MTNA</a> to help map out this CMS service provider landscape by processing data published by CMS as an API. We recorded our session to help share the learnings involved with downloading CMS data and ingesting it <a href="https://www.richdataservices.com/">into MTNA's RDS system</a>, which makes the data more accessible via an web interface as well as an API.</p>

<p>This work is just the first in an ongoing mapping of the healthcare API landscape, and publishing of data and public API workspaces to help make sense of how APIs are being used to ensure that healthcare providers are more interoperable by default. Leveraging the FHIR specification to demonstrate why APIs enable interoperability, but ensuring that all APIs are tested and certified in an going way to ensure they are all speaking the same vocabulary. Helping standardize how healthcare data is made more accessible and able to move from provider to provider, keeping a patients record always up to date no matter where they are getting their healthcare.</p>
