I did a marathon series of open data and specification sessions with our partners over at Metadata Technology North America (MTNA) last week, which during one of them I learned about Ariā, where you can find and download concepts and definitions, classifications, concordances, and standards used for data and statistical activities across New Zealand government. MTNA has put years of work into the platform, which is something they are now also rolling out for Stats Canada. I have had several discussions with MTNA about Ariā, but this working session was my first deep dive into the platform, and the API that power it.
