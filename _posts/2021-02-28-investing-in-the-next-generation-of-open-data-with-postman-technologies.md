Open data is the life blood of APIs and open source. From census data to lists of postal codes, open data drives our applications and platforms. As part of Postman Open Technologies we are looking to understand the current state of open data, while working to find ways to contribute to the conversation in some new and meaningful ways. This work will include the profiling of some of the most common sources for open data from across companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies, then working to make it as accessible and useful throughout the application development lifecycle as we possibly can.

We are beginning this work with the profiling of some of the common sources of open data via common data sources and APIs. We'll then establish public workspaces for ingesting, evolving and iterating upon valuable data, while also highlighting the best practices and sources of data we come across doing research and profiling. We will start with some of the lowest hanging fruit and begin making sure we have public workspaces and collections for the leading open data APIs out there, but then we will work with partners to continue crawling, profiling, ingesting, and making other available data sources more accessible and usable as simple, consistent APIs.

This landing page will become the doorway for open data when it comes to Postman Open Technologies. We will keep this page up to date with a variety of workspaces where you can discover and work with open data. Regularly launching new API workspaces for public data, and encouraging partners to launch their own public workspaces to expand the reach of their valuable data sources to Postman's 14 million developers. Every dataset or open data API we index with a Postman collection and then publish to a public workspace will make that data more discoverable via the Postman network, but also via Google, while also reducing friction when it comes to developers putting the data to work in their applications.
