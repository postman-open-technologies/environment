APIs are machine-to-machine computing interfaces that enable one digital application to use the data and functionalities of another. They are, in a way, the connective tissue of the digital ecosystem. As an under-the-bonnet aspect of digitalisation, users and decision-makers often overlook the importance of APIs. The JRC report “Application Programming Interfaces in Governments: Why, What and How” argues that they should not. When governments did take a stab at rolling out API-based services, the uptake of these was rapid and massive. APIs come with relative low investment and substantial efficiency gains. For example, Estonia’s X-Road platform got off the ground with an initial financing of a mere 300 000 euros. It links up public and private sector data, so that citizens only have to share data with the government once, saving an estimated 800 working years every single week.
