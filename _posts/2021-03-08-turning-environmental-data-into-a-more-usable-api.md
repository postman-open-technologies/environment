The work with our open data partners over at Metadata Technology North America (MTNA) continues, moving from our last post on CMS healthcare data to working with a variety of environmental datasets. I have a couple of open data projects going on right now, and as we find ourselves with a new administration in the United States, as well as getting closer to Earth Day 2021, we figured it would be a good time to help make data that is available as downloadable files more searchable and usable via a more modern web API. I had given the MTNA team ten links to a mix of environmental data sets last week, and this week they came back to me with the next steps for deploying each one as a more accessible API, something we cover in the video of our regular open data discussions.
