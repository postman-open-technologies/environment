I am working with our open data partners over at Metadata Technology North America (MTNA) to publish a mix of open data APIs across a variety of areas. First up on the list are the providers. We are working to better understand how APIs are being used in healthcare, and to help us in our journey we are taking the data files on characteristics of hospitals and other types of healthcare facilities, including the name and address of the facility and the type of Medicare services the facility providers, and looking to make available via a first class API.
